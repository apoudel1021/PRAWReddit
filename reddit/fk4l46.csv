Their has to be a way to make this work.I work as a Logistics Manager for a small Foundry Distribution Company and they have no plan in place and act like I shouldn't be worried.Every single day I see at least 12 truck drivers from different company who in turn see 30 other customers every single day. Those customers are also in contact with hundreds of people every day. If you do that math I'm in contact with thousands of people every single day.My wife is a teacher so she is home for a month but I still come home every day.On top of all that we just found out she is about 7 weeks pregnant....I am worried every day that I am going to bring this virus into our household. We have not seen any information on how this effects pregnancy especially at this early of a stage.Hopefully our country unifies and rolls out a decent plan.Be safe and smart everyone!,fkttyds,fk4l46,2020-03-18 08:28:17

Can someone make this make sense (with sources) How will quarantining prevent the spread when the incubation period is so long and people often do not have symptoms? Can't those asymptomatic carriers continue to spread the virus?Not one person of power explained the de-quaratine process. Are we just gonna open the gates like everything is normal in 6 to 8 weeks?,fksxysc,fk4l46,2020-03-17 23:11:09
"My company's reaction seems insidious. First (late last week), they implemented an optional work from home policy for anyone whose children whose schools or daycares were closed, or who was self-quarantining due to recent travel, exhibiting symptoms, etc.. Everyone else was expected to come into the office. This week, they opened up the optional work from home policy to everyone. Yet, leadership is supposed to emphasize that ""some activities must be done in the office"" (so, the ability to work from home is tempered by the requirement to come in once a week to fulfill those requirements), and we can't forbid customers from coming by because it could diminish quality of service. When the policy was made available to everyone, some perks were made available for employees who chose to come into the office that hadn't been available before. And of course, since some employees choose to come in, members of leadership must come in as well.Ordinarily, I would think that the work from home policy was reasonable if not generous, as well as the new perks for those working on site. But in the face of the Coronavirus, it seems like not closing the offices, especially when the work can be done remotely, is not taking the warnings issued by the CDC seriously or taking adequate precautions to protect the employees. Yes, of course we need to be here for our customers, especially in such uncertain times. But at what cost? Who isn't taking the warning to not come in if they're feeling ill seriously because they have COVID-19 and think it's seasonal allergies, or they're completely asymptomatic but carrying it? Which employees don't think the coronavirus is a serious threat at all, so aren't bothering to practice social distancing while in the office, or are too oblivious to their own actions to observe personal space/boundaries? How many of the activities that ""must be done in the office"" actually must be done there? I'm a child free by choice employee (so, left out of the first wave). And I'm scared.",fksxwr7,fk4l46,2020-03-17 23:10:30

"It feels like we are always one step behind. When we could have stopped it at the borders, we called it a hoax. When we could have arrested it in just a few cities, we refused test kits and tracing cases. When it was in every large city, they cancelled schools and large gatherings and said it was too late to test and trace. Every two days it doubles and we are told to do one more thing.

"I'm already in lockdown until April 14th. What is America waiting for. Close up shop, hit the pause button on the economy and join in with the rest of the world who did the same thing.All you're doing is throwing money at the economy and it's not going to help at all. Complete waste of time. But you know Americans aren't too bright. They cherish those liberties and freedoms a bit too much and have too much faith in those safety nets which are going to come crashing down if you don't stay home and quarantine.Lemme tell u what it's like. As for jobs you can forget about it. Only things allowed open is takeout and delivery, grocery stores and hospitals. That is it, nothing else. If you're caught outside you face fines or arrest if you have no valid reason to be out which isn't considered breaking the quarantine measures.All your rents and mortgages go bye bye. In a national emergency the US government has the authority to suspend rent payments for renters and businesses. Landlord can't kick you out because the courts won't enforce them. Landlord will get their money back when they do taxes.Electric and other utility bills will be suspended. You will still have to pay them but there will be no due dates for the duration of the quarantine. Government maybe nice and give you a year to get that month paid. Food, you are on your own but no worries, government won't let you starve.That's a little taste of what it's like.",fkseehm,fk4l46,2020-03-17 19:36:47

"Have a light annoying cough that's been coming and going, wanted to take a few vacation days to sit on it and see if it worsens. Job won't approve even vacation time unless I have a note from my Dr that says I'm sick. So, like most jobs, we all have to work until we get sick or sicker. A 14 day shut in as least would probably curb alot of panic and stress over all of this. Give people time to sit at home, relax and take a breather.

"Trump needs to declare a national quarantine ASAP! Just read an article where a man in Kentucky has refused to quarantine since he was confirmed positive, thankfully the local sheriff’s department is forcing him to by surrounding his house and watching it 24/7 for the next two weeks.

I work at a barbershop that has a high volume of clients everyday. People haven't been cancelling their appointments. They are still showing up even though they are in close proximity to multiple people (we usually have 4 customers in the shop every 30 minutes) and most clients don't take this situation seriously. I ended up having to do a temporary leave of absence due to living at home with someone who is at high risk of infection and severe symptoms. The company has been emailing us but does not plan to close it's doors until the last minute when the government says so. I worry that it will just cause the virus to spread more rapidly since over 50 people walk in and out of the shop everyday. Sanitation doesn't do anything when you are in constant interaction. Very nervous to see how this whole situation unfolds.,fkreshp,fk4l46,2020-03-17 13:50:31

"A thought from Italy. It started with the small town of Codogno, where patient 1 was living. They closed Codogno, but authorities announced they'd do it the day before, so many citizens inside flew the night before, bringing the epidemic with them, mainly to touristic towns where the wealthy people of a wealthy town had their vacation homes. Then authorities went on closing Lombardy, but again, they announced it the day before, so all the people that worked far from home, be it towns and cities a few hours away from Milan where they usually commute to, to people that moved from the South of Italy rushed to the night trains to go back home, bringing the epidemic with it. This is how it spread to the whole Peninsula. Mind the timing of the announcements, because they will be vital on the spread of the virus. Think of all the people that moved to NYC from Smallvilles around the US, and see how they will rush back with their load, because for some reason a small city sounds better equipped to face a deadly epidemic than one of the largest metropolis of the world.",fkrbzvn,fk4l46,2020-03-17 13:24:04

"That has exactly nothing to do with what I said. I didn't say do nothing, I simply said that the government saying ""no one can leave their home for two weeks unless essential, all non-essential businesses are closed"" doesn't do anything. It would just reset us and let it spiral out of control again once everything re-opens.That would only work if they could enforce it perfectly (no chance) or had everyone tested and strictly enforced it for those already infected. Even then, wouldn't it just start all over again if it's still running around in the rest of the world unless we keep our borders closed until it's completely eradicated or we have a vaccine?There's a reason everyone's saying social distancing, not quarantine.

"Clinging all hopes to a vaccine is absolutely not the answer. Coronavirus vaccines are notoriously difficult and risky. SARS, a closely related disease and virus, still doesn't have a vaccine and that outbreak was like 2003.The best solution is to pursue drugs to treat it to mitigate symptoms in people where they get bad, as much as possible. And promote quarantining and social isolation to keep the spread slow, so that hospitals aren't overwhelmed at once while treating patients. It's almost impossible to totally prevent it until a vaccine is available, if one ever does pass trials, since this disease is just too contagious and a vaccine is so far out.",fks4eib,fkrmjj5,2020-03-17 17:54:08
