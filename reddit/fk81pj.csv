In Bangladesh there's only 1400 testing kits for 117M people. They are only testing people who recently came from abroad. Many local people with symptoms went to the authority for testing but they were refused. Only 200+ tests are conducted and there are officially 4 confirmed cases. First official death was recorded today and the dead guy did not come from abroad. The real infected number most likely has already crossed 500 and even there are 10+ un-recorded deaths.

I am 26 and had all the symptoms of this virus starting 2 weeks ago. I live in the U.S. and no one ever tested me. I went to the doctors multiple times to find out what was wrong. Nothing. In the end I was told it was bronchitis and that it was a bacteria or virus but no one could tell me what. I lost 14 pounds and I only weighed 181 lbs before I got sick.

"I'm sure the epidemiological models address this but am not sure this will be communicated well by the media (let alone understood/analyzed/whatever by the audience).  My local paper, for example, provided an out of context quote from an official who expects our cases to ""skyrocket"", without saying how many (10x?  100x?  3x?) and how much of it was simply detecting cases that already existed as opposed to more recently/newly infected.  Both groups are a concern (particularly since symptom free people are less likely to self-quarantine, spreading the disease), but there is a difference.  While larger/true numbers might convince some people the severity of the situation, it might also result in some of them (as well as people who have been panicking/hoarding toilet paper here in the US for two weeks already) going way too far the other way, particularly if they just focus on raw numbers (and don't include things like how many more people were tested today compared to a week ago,  Yes, hearing that 95% of people tested negative might strengthen the ""not a big deal"", but there's a difference between 1000 new cases when 2000 tested and 1500 new cases when 9000 tested).  Several people I follow insist that the graph article that former President Obama retweeted recently illustrates how coronavirus itself will spread, even though the article expressly states that simulitis is (far) more infections than the actual COVID-19.It was reasonable to assume that the number of cases would go up as more testing was implemented.  What needs to be stressed/analyzed is how much of the ""new"" cases are new, as opposed to testing catching up.To use the lily pad metaphor from one of the top comments, are the lily pads doubling every interval (I think the projection was every 3 days)?  Or did some of them already exist but just now moved into the visible spectrum (via testing), such that it's ""only"" doubling every 5 days?Also, it seems possible that the initial splits between severe/minor/asymptomatic percentages were going to be skewed toward severe when testing was limited, assuming there wasn't a genuine random sample of otherwise healthy people getting tested for coronavirus, as opposed to people who had been in contact with someone who was infected (with symptoms).  So, instead of being 5/15/80 (or whatever the initial projections were), it is possible that it's something more like 3/12/85 (and, if the 86% figure is accurate, might be even more skewed toward asymptomatic, meaning that, while a positive diagnosis means you should self-quarantine so you don't infect others, each person who is newly infected might be less likely to suffer severe symptoms).Rambling summary: Media needs to try to communicate what the experts are saying.",fksqkkd,fk81pj,2020-03-17 21:48:14

"No kidding.  I live in a rather isolated place in the great Mojave Desert.  My wife and I self isolated 2 weeks ago, and likely have another month to go.  There are probably 15,000 people in a 50 mile radius and several small villages.  I very limited hospital serves the area.  My best friend lives about 8 miles from me.  He and his live-in girlfriend have been sick for the past week with respiratory issues.  Now their daughter is also sick (45 yr old who lives with them).  Last week they called their doc, who told them to just stay home since they did not have high temps.  They got worse.  Called the local doc again and got told “I have no idea where you can get tested”.  Then they called a hotline for a major medical center 100 miles away to see if testing was possible.  No answers or directions other than “if you are experiencing difficulty breathing come in to urgent care”.  They gave up.   Now they are slowly improving.  They never did isolate, and go to a Walmart that is in another locale about every day.  Who know how many people they have exposed - and who knows how many more like them exist?   Trying to trace contacts is way too late.  This thing is totally among us.  So far I am lucky.  My ranch is on a dead-end dirt road, and only on rare occasion does anyone wander in here.   The personal and economic impact of this thing is something that none of us will ever forget.",fksim1h,fk81pj,2020-03-17 20:22:07

As a side note, I don't believe it's possible to contain coronavirus anyway, because most governments are incapable of widespread testing.
