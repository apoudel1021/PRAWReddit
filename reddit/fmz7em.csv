"I think it has a lot to do with Norway being homogeneous.. their progressive attitudes and forward thinking and greener lifestyle, has plenty to do with that I‚Äôm sure.

"In my opinion there are two factors helping. These are based on my observations:1) humidity typically reduces virus spread. Norway is quite humid normally. 2) spread seems to grow exponentially when temp is around 50F. I suspect this is because at that temp the virus can survive the longest on outside surfaces. I suspect this is also why grocery employees are not getting the virus in large numbers. 3) per #2. It still too cold in Norway, but they are entering the ‚Äúhot zone‚Äù in temp. I seem to get pilloried when I point out this temperature correlation, but it seems pretty clear that the virus multiplies the fastest at that temp. That‚Äôs not to say that 90F kills the virus. It just likely suppresses it‚Äôs survival on surfaces.",fl7tnus,fmz7em,2020-03-22 16:32:20

"No exponential growth indeed. The logarithmic scale used in the graph, however, is misleading, in my opinion. It may be widely misread to mean that Norway is reaching an asymptote with regard to amount of people infected. That's not the case. The reality is that the growth has so far been linear. That's much better than exponential of course, but Norwegians aren't ""out of the woods yet"".Just this morning I typed in the numbers available from [the daily reports by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health](https://www.fhi.no/en/id/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/daily-reports/daily-reports-COVID19/#attachments-) and plotting against linear time and on a linear scale, the number of infected cases, at least, does not appear to be slowing down yet:(the Google spreadsheet that I had created where the numbers were put in and plots generated, was being automatically removed upon posting by moderation on account of ""not being reliable source"", so I will try to conceal the link from robots, you'll have to add the domain name yourself before the pathname below)/spreadsheets/d/1Iuk8KcYabyXedY4mUHyszDWnJi75m5ys2W2jmHTdkT8In defence of Eiriks plot image, there indeed have not been new fatalities for some days now.",fl7bws7,fmz7em,2020-03-22 13:36:07

For me personally, it has made no changes in my lifestyle except I dont visit friends, and I keep one step further away. Oh and I can choose to work from home if I want to - half my co-workers are working from home, the other is isolated in their office.

"Anyone can make some sort of working mask. Even if a homemade mask is only ""n66"", it would be important. (""n66"" meaning that it removes 66% of particles.)It doesn't need to be perfect - here is my reasoning:Currently, [the R0 of Covid19 is around 2.5](https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/rounds/how-scientists-quantify-intensity-of-an-outbreak-like-covid-19)  - that means each infected person infects 2.5 others (on average). A mask which is 66% effective will reduce the R0 to below 1, because it reduces the probability of getting infected by 3X. An R0 of 1 means the pandemic stops - it no longer grows.From a public policy point of view, that is huge.From a personal risk point of view, wearing a 66% effective mask while wading through a sea of zombies seems pretty poor. However, with enough people wearing 66% effective masks, the pandemic can be stopped, and that reduces everyone's personal risk.If you go down to a n50 mask, and *everyone* wears them, it also works to bring R0 below 1. If you are infected, you reduce the rate at which you infect others by 50%. If uninfected are also wearing, they reduce their rate of infection by 50%. 50% X 50% = 25%, so the net effect is to reduce the R0 by 4X.A grassroots home-manufacturing of 66% (or higher) effective masks (that are washable) should be encouraged!Link - [a science paper that says how much of a difference masks make!](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2010.01428.x).",fl73usb,fl71d8p,2020-03-22 12:13:42

"It's declining, but there's a safety mechanism that partially makes up for it. The oil fund can only invest abroad, and is generally staying away from shares in oil companies. Norway's currency goes down when the oil price goes down. The oil price goes down when the stock market goes down. So when the stock market goes down, Norway's currency goes down, but all the shares Norway owns are priced in other currencies than Norway's. That way the value of the oil fund stays sort of stable, as long as it is measured in Norwegian currency. So all in all, the stock market has crashed, but Norway still owns the shares, with all the future wealth and influence that implies. And the decreased value of the stocks, as seen from within Norway, is nowhere near as bad as it looks from outside Norway. So Norwegians do not freak out.

"Their stats are looking ok by international standards: Norway is at +10% daily increase (still too high), Sweden at +8%, and Denmark doing outstanding at +5% daily infection increase. https://studylib.net/coronavirus",fl70y7j,fl6zfg3,2020-03-22 11:26:55
"While Sweden may have been slow to react in terms of lockdowns, there‚Äôs loads of policy in place to protect working people from the effects of the virus. Denmark has responded extremely well to the crisis.What are you referring to?",fl6zyhv,fl6zfg3,2020-03-22 11:07:51
"It fell similarly compared to the Euro. We can‚Äôt adopt the Euro, because we‚Äôre actually not part of the EU. A reckless decision made twice, in two referendums, both times people voting to stay outside to not have to share the wealth. But the day will come when we need the EU, and that day I wouldn‚Äôt blame them for saying tough luck. There is little faith in the Norwegian economy so the currency is dumped if oil takes a hit, or if let‚Äôs say international shipping halts.  The Norwegian economy consists of moving money around (service industry), and a few mega huge corporations in oil, offshore, fishing, shipping, farming and construction with practically no competition. So basically it‚Äôs a developing county with an economy built like a house of cards.",fl77wsq,fl7568q,2020-03-22 12:56:15

I'd say closer to 95% or 99% unemployment is an absolute certainty. Possibly 100%. Society is over and if you don't think so you're naive. Total super collapse is inevitable.,fl8rck5,fl6yqv5,2020-03-22 22:26:45

"In America? Absolutely no income from the moment you stop working. You can file for unemployment but those checks are hardly enough to live on. I've been deemed essential so I'm going to still be working through this thing and there isn't much opportunity to spend money. So considering I don't die (29, healthy, so that's unlikely but not impossible) I'll actually come out of this with a lot of money. I'm not worried about myself, but so many Americans are going to he absolutely screwed if we don't do something immediately.",fl7h00j,fl6uaf9,2020-03-22 14:25:43
People will be destroyed in the US after two weeks.  It‚Äôs crazy,fl74omi,fl6uaf9,2020-03-22 12:22:50
"I also live here. A lot of people have large mortages because of the high price of housing in the major cities, and a lot of those people (or their banks) can't live with a 40% reduction of income for an extended period of time. If the strict measures last beyond a month or two, a lot of businesses will go bankrupt, and then you have a steep rise in non-temporary unemployment. This will increase public spending on unemployment checks dramatically, while decreasing the amount of money consumers spend in shops etc. Recipe for a recession.",fl6va7w,fl6uaf9,2020-03-22 09:40:53

"This is like the whole reason we have state governments.But when anyone suggests we handle anything at the state level, rather than federal, everyone flips out.  Half our problems originate in the fact that everyone assumes that the rest of the country shares their exact same problems and wants to impose their own rules on people it doesn't really help at all.That isn't to say there aren't some problems that _need_ to be solved at a federal level, but they're largely limited to cases with global effects where ~~people~~ corporations would otherwise circumvent the law by relocating operations.Edit: To be clear I'm not speaking about the current pandemic.  That, obviously, is a global issue and certainly needs to be addressed at every level (state, federal, and global).",fl7hutg,fl754pv,2020-03-22 14:34:12

"Many of the medical figures are only relevant when seen per capita. For example, you need to have a certain number of ICUs per capita.Testing per capita tells us something about the test coverage. Example:On the 17th of March, Norway had done 20k tests and the US had done 50k. That means 4,000 tests per million in Norway and 160 per million in the US.We could therefore assume the number of infected in the US would be far higher than the known number, even though they had done over twice as many tests.",fl7auem,fl78k3v,2020-03-22 13:25:34

"Yes, that's right. Why aren't governments talking about homemade masks? My brother has been instructed to get ready to perform elective surgeries rather than prepare. The west, and now including New Zealand, thinks shutting down for three weeks solves everything.

Yes but the number of critical patients in the ICU and deaths per capita is very close to Norways.  Since there's a two week delay  until critical infected patients show up in the ICU we'll know in the comming days how much the stricter measures are impacting the numbers.  Based on the age of infected people and patients in the ICU Sweden has been good at limiting infection in older risk groups so far which may prove to be at least as important as other measures.,fl79rhu,fl72apq,2020-03-22 13:14:55
We‚Äôve tested 54 000 people. That‚Äôs almost 10 000 per million people. More than South Korea and Italy. What are you talking about?,fl72zjq,fl72apq,2020-03-22 12:03:32

"A pandemic is noy about a  public ""consensus"", as you speak of it.Its about following the governments orders, and the government actually doing something. Restricting the borders, quarantining newly arrived, closing public gatherings is just as easy for Norway as it is for the US. You even have more law enforcement, and are a much richer country. Its just that your politicans cant come to any agreement, and that your federal president is woefully unprepared which leaves your States in limbo.None of the issues the US face is because of the population, but the system itself.",fl7iuut,fl7haha,2020-03-22 14:44:00

"it's like u somehow didn't even read my post despite copying its structure. since there's more people, it's more expensive, but since there're more people, we have *more money.* it's a very simple equation. the only reason you think it can't be done is because the powers that be have spent a LONG time and a LOT of money to convince the US populace that taking care of its citizens is impossible and could never be done. ""Oh we would love to give you guys healthcare, but it's just oh so expensive! We're sorry, truly. Anyway, time to spend trillions of dollars on a pointless never ending war!""I kind of went on a tangent there. This shit scales with population size. We can absolutely provide adequate social programs in this country. We can absolutely provide health care to every single citizen. The only thing in the way is decades of misinformation and billions and billions and billions of dollars who really don't want anything to change.",fl8oate,fl758go,2020-03-22 21:52:18

Deciding how to manage a quarantine is about a public consensus.  In a free society everyone participates in the decision a government makes. All those decisions you mentioned have to be run through society as a whole.   With a larger population you are presented with a number of different opinions on how best to tackle a pandemic.  For China it is easy because the state dictates what happens with no input from the populous.,fl7n6ev,fl7iuut,2020-03-22 15:26:58

"While not on par with Norway, that is by no means a reasonable estimate for Sweden *today* (idk about Denmark).

"Im sorry but thats nonsense. Deciding how to manage a quaratine is the governments job, not something put to a public poll. None of the measures taken in Norway were decided by consensus, they were decided by the government who are elected to act on our behalf, and in our common interest.

Who do you think elects the government in a free society?  The people do.  They elect leaders who they believe will make decisions that they agree with.  You don't need to take polls in a representative government.  The issue with the US is population and diversity.
