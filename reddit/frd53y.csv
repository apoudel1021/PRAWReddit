Many miss the point of masks and covering your face in general. It protects you a bit but most of all it prevents the spread by asymptomatic carriers.That's why people with actual respirators with one-way valves are asked to cover them with masks as well - the valves protect the wearer but enable the spread of the dissease the person might already carry.,flx2srn,frd53y,2020-03-30 09:06:44

There was a study that showed that even cotton cloth can reduce inhalation of viral particles by 50%. Which is better than nothing.

Healthy people won't benefit from a mask that's true. What happens is that since there are a huge number of asymptomatic infected people. They would be using thinking they are healthy when in fact not and thus avoiding infecting more people.

"Wearing masks surely lowers the chances of contracting the infection; however it is not a foolproof method to avoid coronavirus. Keeping your immune system strong enough is always preferable as the virus won't be able to infect / replicate and create active disease inside body. Nature has given every living entity a defence mechanism (immune system) to combat microorganisms. Everybody exposed to virus doesn't suffer from active disease and every sufferer has different intensities of disease, just because everyone has different levels of immunity. Antiviral drugs and vaccines are not going to help you always and forever, believe in your own immunity and keep it strong!",flwjyt7,frd53y,2020-03-30 03:31:20

"You know what really slows the spread of infection: Stay at Home.That's what Belgium is doing and so far it seems we have a handle on the situation :1. Enforce work@home (if not possible employer must adhere to social distance rule otherwise close the company temporarily)2. Only food shops, newspaper stands and pharmacies are open. Restaurant and pubs closed but takeaway is allowed3. Outside travel only allowed for work or necessary reasons4. People can still relax outside with family (living under the same roof) or with 1 friend but always adhering the social distance rule5. Implement temporarily unemployment benefits for  employees of closed business (employee receives 70 % wage paid by the state.  This reduces the cost for business on condition that they rehire the unemployed staff after the crisis). Banks will also allow temporarily suspension of mortgages under specific individual conditions. Because nobody is immune to Corona these measures are not intended to stop the spread of the infection but to slow it down as not to overwhelm the hospitals.

It is far cheaper and less painful than losing all our 401ks, jobs, own or loved one's lives!!Trust and educate the public to not take medical masks away from frontline workers - we will get ours when enough production is ramped up, until then - improvise, make our own, wear a scarf, a bandana, a towel, make our own, whatever you can to cover mouth and nose.CDC Please - the current policy is deeply flawed and costly...",flwc7u1,frd53y,2020-03-30 01:22:52
"2 dish cloths sewn together can block out up to 73% of .02 micron particulates. That dish cloth mask also has a pocket where l can add a non-woven layer, such as dried out lysol antibacterial wipes or paper towels, which are disposed of after each use. The non-woven layer adds up to an additional 7% of protection. I now have the equivalent of an N80 mask. Given the choice between N0 (not wearing a mask) and a N80 mask (dish towel mask stuffed with a lysol wipe), I'll take the N80 mask.No mask will give you 100% protection against Covid-19, but what these masks do is lower the risk of contracting Covid-19 if you are exposed to an asymptomatic carrier or someone who refuses to follow social distancing rules.Still, stay the fuck home.

"OK but. I lived in CZ until two years ago and still have a lot of friends there under quarantine. I've been following the situation there and it is by NO means a typical one. They shut down early and very effectively, for one thing, basically before most other European countries other than Italy (I believe Spain was even still open at that point). I had Czech friends that rushed to get home within less than 24 hours before the borders closed. On top of that, like many smaller countries, a lot of the policy is dictated by what's happening in the capitol city, Prague, because a disproportionate amount of the population lives there, and shutting down the metro was not an option if you wanted to get critical workers to work. There's not a lot of science behind the cover your face in public rule, and there never was. I'm no expert of course and I'm not saying it does nothing. But in any event it was introduced so quickly and suddenly in CZ that there was no way they actually did any studies on the actual efficacy. What they did know was that 1) it would make people feel a little bit better about using the metro/trams/busses when they need critical staff still showing up for work, particularly with such a deep metro system (take note London), and 2) it would help reinforce solidarity, which I feel CZ has been exceptionally good at doing throughout this (I'm following at least eight countries I've lived in closely, and so far CZ has had the best response out of all of them in my opinion).And let me re-emphasize, I don't know one way or the other whether homemade masks do work or not. But at the time the CZ government demanded everybody cover their face in public, CZ definitely couldn't have either. It's been an effective measure in a way in that people feel like they're doing something concrete that helps and that they're all in the same boat.

The government even allowed the notions shop to open again for the public because lot of people started sewing.And Czechs don't have enough masks, not even for all the doctors.

"Prior beliefs and common sense tell that a population-wide mask usage should greatly mitigate the spread. The burden on proof is on people who claim masks don't work.Slovaks are also clad with masks, and their numbers are more promising; doubling cases every 8 days paints a tad more optimistic picture than Czechia's 5 days. Though it is in line with some other countries, like Denmark or Bulgaria, who don't mandate mask usage. Luckily, most of the small European countries don't experience a rapid exponential growth anymore; more like a linear continuation of the previous trend. Perhaps the health authorities in smaller countries are better able to micro-manage the situation? Perhaps it's just a projection of limited testing?All of this is complicated by an expansion of testing capacity. Numbers might indicate the measures don't work, but could it simply be a result of clearing the testing backlog? Every country rations their tests differently, which skews the data unpredictably.It's somewhat frustrating that countries and their media stopped providing background information on the new cases - are they health workers, clusters, families of the sick, repatriates, or random people on the street?

I agree. Masks stop infected people passing on the virus and protect uninfected people from getting it. It's not that the other things being recommended don't work. They do. It's just that adding masks to the mix takes it from a 50%ish reduction in risk of getting infected to more like a 90% reduction. It did for SARS anyway. That's a big difference and means a lot fewer people in hospital.,flwdjvd,flw09v2,2020-03-30 01:43:06

"I honestly believe that our government doesn't want us to wear them because the CDC doesn't believe they work.  However,  I read a post that quoted an article in the British medical journal, Lancet, that said in studies done, larger viral droplets did not pass through a mask, so they may offer some protection.  That convinced me, and now I wear one.  I wish people would stop stigmatizing the wearing of masks.  Too many people worry about about what people will think if they wear a mask, when their priority ought to be their health.  I just saw on the news up here in Maine, that 2 Hannaford supermarket employees have tested positive for coronavirus.  The store said that neither had worked for a few days.  However,  incubation time can be from 2 to 14 days. I wish these stores would understand that the masks help to protect both customers AND employees.  Going to a store to buy your groceries is becoming a terrifying prospect.  I personally have autoimmune conditions. Do store managers really think this is business as usual.
