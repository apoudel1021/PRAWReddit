"Just a theory, these doctors are working so hard that when they get it they don't allow themselves the time they need to recover and then they die.

"I do not know if China intentionally leaked the virus to fuck U.S after the trade war, whatnot or it happened accidently.(hope so). Either way, China would have to pay for all of the loss once this tragedy has gone. Xi Jin POOH and the CCP have been acting, speaking like there is zero fault of theirs and even saying like they are helping other countries which is ridiculously ironic. Xi Jin POOH once said something like ""we are doing great, all are under control and other countries thank china for helping them blah blah"" I think they are shameless bastards like always. As you already feel, I personnaly hate CCP, Xi Jin POOH since they have never contributed a single good, positive thing or effect into the world, but also harrasing chinese ppl on the street is not the answer and we should not do that. (Im S.Korean who hates being misrecognized as chinese sometimes since we both have same asian look BTW) the world officially have to make concrete plans to make the CCP and Xi Jin POOH pay for all the loss after this current shitty time goes away instead of harassing chinese individuals who has nothing to do with this corona shit. Thats my point. I guess China will have to sell its fucking country to pay for all the loss",fmdmluj,fucuhe,2020-04-03 23:42:37

That there were many things we could have done, the least of them providing proper PPE. That the government (at least the feds) didn't help. That the hospitals were still greedy and authoritative.As a relative of someone in a medical field, I say being called a hero isn't worth it. No, we're not all in this together.

"To ease your worry: As soon as your wife comes home, 1) strip, 2) clothes in the laundry, 3) spray shoes with chlorohexadine (edit: don't spray with this, the lovely people who commented gave me some more recent information and a useful link!) or leave in sun, 4) wife showers/bath (optional follow up with good quality moisturiser because all the hand washing has probably already aggravated her skin), 5) spray down/clean door knobs, keys, car door handles, floor etc (1:50 bleach to water or the recommended dilution on your preferred household cleaner). My sister and I have both worked in places where we could bring bacterial or viral infections home and developed this particular routine for going between work and home.If your wife becomes sick: no working. I don't care if Trump, the queen or bloody Nelson Mandela rises from the grave. Rest and recover first. As a healthcare professional, you must follow the Red Cross idea that you cannot save someone if you are drowning yourself.Try get some extra fruit, vegetables (chilli, garlic and ginger too) in and spend some time in the sunlight and get enough sleep. There's no real magical immune booster, but it's always good to give yourself adequate resources to keep as healthy as possible. This is a crazy time. I can't say I know how frightening this is for you, because it's never been my spouse or children in danger, but I hope you, your wife and your children keep safe and healthy. And remember: for all Sars-CoV-2's strengths, it is terribly weak to regular soap and water (anything with sodium lauryl/laureth sulphates, household cleaners, etc).

My 2 cents on how to blow of steam:Soap and water. Clean your house every day from top to bottom. Have a clean set of clothes for your wife daily. Let's see what else can i let you clean... Oh yes teach your 5 year old to wash it's hands after playing outside and before eating. Clean Clean Clean. Don't forget to wear some rubber gloves or your hands dry out when cleaning.Seriously that's the best you can do for now. A virus is bit of bad stuff rapped in a fat outer layer. Soap and water wil dissolve and kill it.Just make sure your wife can relax and rest when she is home.,fmcmy5q,fmcl2f1,2020-04-03 17:19:38

"That's a little presumptuous. You don't know at what age she may have had her children or if, indeed, they are not children through adoption, etc. I won't hack you on your statistics but I would point out that healthcare workers tend to be individuals at high risk for two reasons: 1) exposure, 2) constant stress (release of cortisol suppresses the immune system). His fears are valid, doctors (even the young ones) are getting severely ill and even dying. I don't really hold with general panic but the other reason she has to be especially cautious is for her other patients, if she is ill or asymptomatic, that's other people, potentially other high risk individuals, being exposed.Side note: not an epidemiologist, did consider becoming one when I was a teenager.Also not intending to scold anyone, just trying to point out why awareness and caution are important.",fmd1lcu,fmcjlu5,2020-04-03 19:42:01

Have a friend who is part of a cleaning crew that’s been hired for a local hospital. He’s under NDA to tell people he’s there to ensure they’re decontaminating stuff to prevent the spread. He said some nurses aren’t allowed to leave because they tested positive but are still well enough to care for the pediatric ward for all the kids who have it. The hospital is lying to their staff and he’s hinted at nurses to get back into their car and leave because they would not be protected when they walked in.,fmd4jbl,fmcm3bv,2020-04-03 20:12:46

We're not lowering the total amount of people who get sick, but, rather, we are lowering the burden on the healthcare system at any one point in time--so that when people do get sick they can actually get medical care. therefore a higher proportion of those who get sick will get a chance to live. Eventually, we hope, things will get better as more people are immune after recovering so there is less spread. The ultimate goal is to hold out ""12-18"" months for a vaccine to be developed. In other words, the ideal path is cycles of social distancing and release depending on the prevalence of infection at a given time.

"Okay I can agree Obama didn't magically fix healthcare and healthcare infrastructure but what exactly did he fumble?Trump has been taking an axe to everything he thinks wastes money, like say a CDC post in Wuhan.  He spent weeks calling this a flu and saying vaccines and treatments were going to be a short movie montage away.  Governors were begging for help but weren't being nice enough.  Other governors, even worse, agreed it's a flu that spreads after you get symptoms so no worry.  Then piecemeal implementation of anything close to useful advice or structure.  Trump told states to go buy their own equipment leading to bidding wars before buying up supplies states already contacted for.Look Obama possibly could have done more.  Considering how hard it was too achieve what he did manage and how excited Republicans have been to undo it, I doubt anything more would have lead to anything other than Trump undoing even more of it.  But let's say with our perfect hindsight Obama decided to use his political capital to prepare for a future pandemic of unknown origins, symptoms and timelines.Let's also both agree it worked.How does that actually help?  America is not one of the world's great healthcare providers.  Even in countries with fantastic systems it's public policies that have seemed to have the greatest impact.  It doesn't matter how many beds and ventilators and masks it have in cases continue to grow exponentially.Trump supporters today are still saying he's doing a great job with a flu that Democrats and the news are trying to use to empower the deep state or whatever.

It might be about more than just looks. PPE/safety policy is a whole science in itself. Any industry where you have employees in danger you have to have policy mechanisms to ensure PPE quality and proper use dovetail with your larger system of containing hazardous elements. On top of safety you have insurance requirements related to liability to get sued by your employees. And any policy not strictly enforced really might as well not have been created in the first place. These policies can be truly intended to protect people but they get very complex and cumbersome. Now suddenly you have a need to rewrite the policy based on scarcity of supplies in a place where scarcity is almost unimaginable. So it’s a tough balancing act of changing policies in an agile way that makes sense without creating deadly holes in your quarantine systems. It’s a giant complicated mess and hospital administrators and doctors and everybody else are going to make a hell of a lot of mistakes trying to muddle through it.,fmdopj6,fmdn65j,2020-04-04 00:09:57

"They are taking about particle droplet transmission, which is confirmed.  That is not the same as airborne.  Particle droplets are heavy, and can only travel ~6 feet, which is where the social distancing rule comes in.  Airborne can travel much farther> Droplet transmission occurs when a person is in in close contact (within 1 m) with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing or sneezing) and is therefore at risk of having his/her mucosae (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes) exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets. Transmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person.8 Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer).  >Airborne transmission is different from droplet transmission as it refers to the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei, which are generally considered to be particles <5μm in diameter, can remain in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 m.https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/modes-of-transmission-of-virus-causing-covid-19-implications-for-ipc-precaution-recommendations",fmdbdv5,fmd1gfg,2020-04-03 21:27:34
