Anyone got anything to say now that the updated data dropped Alabama from 1st to 21st in expected death rate?  Hope you ghouls who were gloating about the people who would die in Alabama get whats coming to you.,fmma6cd,fuy081,2020-04-06 15:33:39
"Just gonna update this to those who want to see it, this model has been wrong on Alabama for awhile 4 days now. It had the estimated daily deaths for April 4 higher than total deaths up until April 3rd. They updated the model now and the amount of projected deaths dropped from over 5500 to just under 1000. https://covid19.healthdata.org",fmkcodi,fuy081,2020-04-06 01:24:44

When this is over... line up the per capital death rate on a graph and sort from lowest to highest.  Overlay the party affiliation of the governor and you will see an extremely clear picture.   This will be in spite of trumps attempts to withhold medical supplies from blue states while flooding those same supplies into red states. This will be in spite of red state governors attempting to obstruct testing and skew numbers.  Red states will have profouny higher death rates specifically because of the leaders chosen in those states.  Mark my words.,fmi5w87,fuy081,2020-04-05 12:11:07

"I am liberal, a doctor, and with a 94 year old grandmother who lives in Alabama and is on comfort care because she has lymphoma which causes her to need a pleural effusion around her lung drained twice per week. My cousin also lives in Alabama and works as an ER nurse.I am angry at Republican leaders like Kay Ivey. It isn't about scoring political points. It's because they are, as usual, ignoring science in favor of ignorance. It is because they are disproportionately killing people in their states and towns compared to Democratic governors like my own, who acted proactively and early. It is because their own cavalier attitude to a deadly pandemic will be mirrored by the citizens who look to them for leadership. I am not angry with the people on the ground who will die because of their leaders' incompetence. I am angry with those leaders for persisting in false pride (""We're not California"") rather than exhibit real leadership, at the cost of victims like my grandmother. I'm terrified because my grandmother's home health caregiver seemed shocked that my dad cancelled tickets to see my grandmother two weeks ago because he was ""actually taking this cold seriously"" because she is taking cues from people like Kay Ivey and Fox News. I am terrified because that means she could very well spread this to my grandmother through her own misguided recklessness and I know odds are my grandmother has no chance of survival if she catches it, and I can't fly out to see her until this is all over so I probably won't be seeing her again. I'm terrified because when my cousin's PAPR gives out after countless shifts will the same governor who put off a shelter in place order until far too late to score political points ensure my cousin's hospital has an adequate store as backup? My heart breaks for my cousin who will soon be seeing such unnecessarily high patient censuses she has to start telling patients ""I'm sorry, there just aren't any ventilators left"" because of Kay Ivey, and Trump, and people like them. I'm angry because yeah, I'd be willing to be part of a civilian doctor's draft. But I don't want to go to states like Alabama because I don't trust its leadership to listen to reason and have my back by providing appropriate PPE, because I made an oath to help people but not to be cannon fodder to do it.So yes. I'm angry at most Republican leadership for disproportionately enacting foolish and deadly policies and Fox News for spreading deadly lies and any Democratic leader who acts similarly to them, and it isn't because ""I told you so."" It's because they're killing my patients, killing my colleagues, and will probably kill my family too. This isn't an internet gotcha moment. It's personal for me.

It's less for myself I fear for and more for these good people that I know that also didn't ask for any of this to happen and just want to protect themselves and their loved ones. But since income is so low the choice has to be made to try and work if they can for the ""after"" of this pandemic instead of quitting their ""essential"" jobs and sheltering in place. At this point I'm not worried about myself anymore. As long as the people I care about make it that's all I need. Fuck everything about this pandemic. Fuck the far left and the far right. Fuck politics. People are fucking dying and all people seem to give a shit about is which political party they think is better while band-aids are slapped on bullet wounds.

"No. This isn’t a situation where your personal, individual decisions are exercised in a vacuum and determine your fate alone. This is a situation where leadership decisions determine people’s fates both directly and indirectly en masse, and where individual decisions are not exercised in a vacuum and determine the fate of people around each individual as well. Let’s start from the beginning. First, Trump disbanded a team of experts equipped to deal specifically with pandemics, and instead we have his completely ignorant, unqualified, and unequipped son-in-law running the show instead. Therefore, from the beginning, the US lacked either an adequate response team or adequate testing kits because the US declined to use a test developed by the WHO and instead relied on the CDC to make its own tests, which turned out to be defective, further causing lag. Trump created a travel ban but failed to enforce screening of citizens traveling from hot spots. Once the virus arrived here, we were hamstrung and unable to perform normal epidemiological testing and containment. What we should have done immediately was create a “presumed positive” diagnosis criteria (in this case, probably a lymphopenic patient with unexplained ARDS), developed or used an already-existing fast testing kit, and then tested en masse like South Korea. Incoming travelers should have been quarantined and screened, and every single positive test should have led to screening and quarantine of individuals that sick individual had contacted. We could have contained this early or at the least significantly slowed its spread. But Trump’s administration failed us. After that, failures progressed quickly. Fox News and Trump both spent a significant amount of time we could have been attempting to contain the virus instead calling it an overblown liberal hoax, ingraining a cavalier attitude among its viewers--one that persists in many places. Citizens who follow their advice blindly are the very ones not practicing social distancing and ensuring faster spread of this disease. Instead of a quick-acting, proactive, federal response such as nationwide legally enforced quarantine, we got a piecemeal response with Republican-led states disproportionately failing to enact protective policies--including Florida failing to close its beaches, Florida/Alabama/Texas and other states putting off shelter-in-place policies until long after experts recommended, and Florida and Texas making exceptions for church services to the shelter in place order. Federally, the delay in enacting the Defense Production Act to ensure increased manufacturing of PPE when hospitals nationwide are dangerously low is horrifying. Trump is still quoting a number of deaths in the US of 220,000, a figure that comes from a study which assumes perfect social distancing. Because of his failures and those of (mostly) Republican governors and local leaders, that number is far too low. I suspect the final tally will be closer to 2-3 million or more. The decisions made by these leaders are directly and indirectly leading to a far higher number of deaths than necessary. The curve has not been flattened. Our hospitals will be/are being overwhelmed city by city. We do not have the ventilators, the PPE, or the staff to save everyone when the surge hits. So no, this isn’t about individual choice. Our leaders have failed us and are killing us. For me, personally? Reread my post. My grandmother’s caretaker, a healthcare worker herself, has taken cues from Kay Ivey’s cavalier attitude towards this disease and therefore puts my grandmother at risk. The lack of serious policies in Alabama to protect healthcare workers and citizens put my grandmother and cousin directly at risk, whether they stick to self-quarantine or not (and they are).",fmgexg6,fmgatdq,2020-04-04 20:45:11

">Take no responsibility for electing the idiots.I've been out canvassing for Bernie this election cycle. It must be nice to live somewhere where the progressive winning is a foregone conclusion!The bottom line is millions of Southerners *didn't* vote for this. Georgia's dumbass governor won by a smaller margin than the number of voters he purged prior to the election, and he intentionally underprovided voting machines in the bluest parts of the state. We were fucked from the start. You know how Doug Jones won that most recent Senatorial Special Election in Alabama? Well if those statewide votes had been cast for Alabama's 7 representative districts, he would have won ONE OF THEM because of how gerrymandered Alabama is.But no one seems to give a shit about that, and I don't see anyone making sweeping generalizations about Pennsylvania or Michigan despite their recent electoral blunders. Or hell, look at how precarious [2016 Minnesota was](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Minnesota_Presidential_Election_Results_2016.svg/450px-Minnesota_Presidential_Election_Results_2016.svg.png).Just gets fuckin tiring okay?Finally...>But when it comes to the actions of your elected leaders, you all don't get to point fingers and take no responsibility for electing the idiots.West Coasters do this all the time with respect to Trump.
