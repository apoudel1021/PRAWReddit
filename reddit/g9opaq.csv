There's no way a treatment is ready by the Fall. It takes years to develop a vaccine. And there's never been a vaccine made for coronavirus before either to my knowledge.,foxys81,g9opaq,2020-04-29 07:45:16
"So now experts are 100% percent sure the virus will come back (even though there is no evidence for this, if they have it why aren't they showing it) and kill many more people exactly like sars, bird flu, swine flu did, right? Well sars just went away swine and bird flu are just became seasonal glues after 1_2 years. And everybody talks about how deadly the spanish flu was when it came back but fail to refer to studies proving that a large proportion of people died because of use of high amounts of aspirin used in treatment ( you know aspirin poisoning - the one that gives respiratory and cardiac arrest like the flu) They are 100%sure about this but have basically zero idea about how infectious the virus really is (maybe it's less maybe it's more infectious than they believe). And in the mean time the experts are against antibody testing because they believe the tests are inaccurate ( but they don't believe the same thing about the RT PCR test when for the flu in order to confirm you make blood tests and not PCR) and that for whatever resson even if they were inaacurate that doesn't mean immunity. I agree there is no evidence for immunity (but let's be real for every virus people have at keast a few  a couple of months worth of immunity) and we need to be careful, but knowing the real extent of infection isn't important? They want to surveil people with drones and phonene apps but they don't wanna know that someone who was infected and did not know it may have infected tens of other people thus creating a snowball of infections in a certain area?

I just don’t see how it will be ok considering Texas is 49th in testing and is terrible with case tracing. I feel like the upper powers that be have just accepted that this is what it boils down to.

R0 3+ 75% herd immunity 1 percent ifrPlease tell me why I’m wrong. I think a lot of people are forgetting why we are sheltering in place. I think there has been a tremendous amount of misinformation on the risks a reasonable person could calculate on the back of a napkin. It feels like there are some callous efforts made by a group of people who has accepted this number of fatalities, but has not been forthcoming about the realities of our predicament. I’m tired of weekly talking points. These have been proved misinformed, or misleading time and again. (Don’t think I even need to provide examples, it’s obvious to most)We need a real debate in this country first. Serious experts without an agenda say we are in this the the long haul and this is just getting started. To ignore these numbers is to ignore the true risks. It’s literally like taking a stadium full of people, and a bomb kills 800 - and repeating that 3,200 times across the country. We need to ask ourselves if that what we are willing to do to other people (and yourself) before we make any sort of collective decision to say “fuck it, I’m going to the beach.”You can tell me that I’m wrong, I wish the very real possibility did not exists...but to ignore the possibility is lunacy.",fowj9m1,g9opaq,2020-04-28 20:41:05

Our only hope is that masks save us and social distancing has sunk in among the population.Unfortunately in the US, we also don't have a lot of central control by the Feds, by design I would argue, and this is a real Achilles heal for this nation. We have no national plan, not many regional plans, just printing more and more money to bail out people and businesses. Even if Biden wins, he's not competent either and too old.

The managers at the electronic stores who don’t even raise an eyebrow when you walk through the door? Or the kid who makes $9.41 cents an hour who has homework to finish when he gets off? Is he supposed to be responsible for the health and safety of everyone? Beaches here will be open on Thursday again, too. Just make sure that there aren’t groups of more than ten people together. Who at the beach is going to be responsible for enforcing that? It’s such a good thing that the coronavirus makes sure to count the number of people in your party before infecting you.

"We have a lot of reason to believe that immunity is there and no real reason to believe it isn't. Immune doesn't mean unable to be reinfected, it means unlikely to be reinfected and will experience a very swift, mild form of the illness if so. Also, the body's immune response can fail for all sorts of reasons which is why 3% of people immunized for measles would still develop measles if exposed - but that means 97% will not, which is important for preventing outbreaks.The WHO's statement about immunity was irresponsible. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and we do have a lot of indirect evidence. For example, families. One person gets it, then spreads it to their family but only after a few days. So you know one of them will recover while others are still infected. Why aren't they all perpetually reinfecting each other if this is so contagious and immunity isn't a thing?What we don't know is how long it lasts. It's a few months for a cold and years for SARS, Fauci said he expects immunity to this virus to be somewhere in between, so a couple of years. That means it'll last long enough for us to get a vaccine out.Ok, downvote me but virologists agree with this.

"For 3, immunity, with antibodies and all that, is the process by which the body expels a virus. If someone genuinely recovers from covid-19, they are by definition immune. What we don’t know is how long that immunity lasts, or how effective it is against varying sizes of viral loads, which is why WHO came out with that comment last week- likely in an attempt to dissuade countries like Sweden from pursuing herd immunity, and to keep Germany and Italy from relying too much on immunity cards. Of course, as this is a virus, we have every reason to *expect* that a recovered person has immunity for a substantial period- there is currently no evidence against that, but as this is a novel virus, we can’t say for certain without evidence explicitly confirming that. Best not to base policy decisions on expectations and assumptions. As for 4, honestly we can’t know about long term effects until at least after a year- the pandemic may well be over before we understand that. Most of the things you mentioned are aspects of any kind of severe respiratory disease, including flu like illnesses.

">Of course, as this is a virus, we have every reason to  >  >expect  >  >that a recovered person has immunity for a substantial period- there is currently no evidence against that, but as this is a novel virus, we can’t say for certain without evidence explicitly confirming that.You should read about the immunity research from SARS and MERS (other coronavirus infections recently).  The studies vary.  In MERS there were people that had absolutely no immunity, others averaged 3 years.  In SARS some have it still, others were as short as 3-6 months.Basically it's not a safe assumption that we'll acquire immunity and it will last a super long time.

Immunity from one strain doesn't mean immunity from other strains. This is why it's better to be safe until more is known.Since Covid-19 is a flu-type virus, it can and will mutate. That's why there is no vaccine for the common flu, there's thousands of strains and getting a flu shot will only immunize you for the more common strains so you can still catch the others. Scientists have said the mutation of Covid-19 is rather slow compared other flu viruses so that's good news. The bad news is we've never successfully developed a cure or vaccine for all previous Coronaviruses. And yes, we will not know any long term impacts until more time has passed.

"I’m not trying to be alarmist. It’s a virus. It’s going to circulate until there’s a vaccine. It’s not nearly as deadly, but it’s tracking similar to the Spanish Flu. That lasted from January 1918 to December 1920. Science has advanced leaps and bounds since then, obviously, but we’re still dealing with a lot of unknowns. Would I like it to end before then? Yes, absolutely. Who wouldn’t? But vaccines take time, and we’ll be very lucky if they get it right the first time.We live in a new world now. Temporarily, anyway. Things will suck for a while. The best thing we can do now is continue to stay at home as much as humanly possible. A virus with nowhere to go will die. Unfortunately, there’s a lot of people that believe, for some reason, that asking them to stay home to prevent transmission of the virus is an infringement on their civil liberties or whatever, and that only extends the life of the virus.If we had a magic wand that could make everyone freeze in place for a month, we’d stomp this virus out. But we don’t, that’s impossible. So we have to make adjustments.And you can curse at me if it makes you feel better. Curse at the sky. Curse at whatever you feel like. But the unique thing about this is we’re all in this together. Everyone. Globally. I’m feeling the stress and frustration too.

It appears from early evidence that SARS-CoV-2 mutates at a rate similar to that of other Coronaviruses, which is substantially slower than that of influenza. 8 different strains doesn’t necessarily mean 8 different types of viruses to counter, in fact it seems like the antigens on each virus and antibodies needed to counter them are essentially similar enough that one vaccine should do the trick, at least as I write this. The 8 strains as it stands is mostly useful for measuring spread, and where it spread from. It’s true we haven’t really made vaccines for coronaviruses before, but keep in mind most coronaviruses in human transition prior to this outbreak caused the common cold, which is at most a minor inconvenience. SARS and MERS were certainly deadly, but they petered out before making a vaccine was profitable or useful. It’s not necessarily because of the difficulty.",fowjcnf,fow5vvr,2020-04-28 20:41:53
"I read that a big question about antibodies/immunity is that has not been determined what ""load"", or volume, of antibodies you need in order to be ""immune"". Like with the chicken pox virus; if you only had a very very mild case when you were 6, you could get the chicken pox again when you were 8. Does having a very mild, maybe asymptomatic case of COVID-19 in fact confer immunity? Is there a way to not just detect *any* antibody, but to determine how *many* antibodies you have? And how long does having antibodies protect you?",fowhp2d,fow5vvr,2020-04-28 20:26:31
"Now, someone correct me if I'm wrong.If I recall correctly, all the multiple covid-19 strains are similar enough that a vaccine or post infection immunity should work to defeat the other strains. Also, yes, it will mutate. But its slow enough that we should be able to stay ahead of it with a vaccine..",fow790s,fow5vvr,2020-04-28 18:51:53

If everything is allowed to go to shit it is all on them. Where is their relief effort? If they keep saying ""reopen and die"" then they don't care about you. They only care about the money you can make. *They* need to look after *you*, not the other way around. I see people from the US complaining about wanting to go back to work. Fuck that. Demand more from your government. Demand that they take steps to make sure you and yours are okay during the lockdown, that you have enough to eat and that you aren't evicted, that your car insurance can't gouge you while you can't even drive your car, that the bank can't continue to ask for loan repayments while you can't work.

How about instead of thinking about your discomfort, you think about the person that's going to never see another Christmas?If you're bothered by open disparagement of people who are not listening, sit down and think just how much discomfort is worth someone's mother or father. At least then you'll be able to draw a line and tell others at what point the lives of your countrymen is worth less than your discomfort.
