The fact that $600 a week is a lot to some individuals does not reflect on the necessity or relevance of the individuals job.  Rather it reflects on the cost of living for said individual.My initial involvement in this thread was to point out that I live very comfortably in Oklahoma and the extra $600 a week is a lot based on our COL.  To claim my job is not necessary because what equates to an extra 29k a year is substantial to me is just lazy.,fp4h4ql,gauavq,2020-04-30 22:08:54

"If you read the article it's actually a pretty reasonable stance. Basically says unless you have a legitimate health concern or fall into a risk category, you can't just collect unemployment benefits if you're employer is offering you your job back at the same or greater pay.Literally it's just so people don't abuse the system that is currently paying them more than they would normally make given the additional federal assistance.

Ok...so person is back to reapplying for unemployment due to underemployment, and waiting to get money again. What a mess.

Our particular restaurant has been doing better than expected with our to-go service and raw product sales.

"Like it or not, this is normal. Note I'm not defending the program, just stating that this shouldn't come as any surprise.* Company moved to a dangerous part of town and you're worried about your safety? Tough.* Company cut your pay 20% and you don't want to work for the new amount? Tough.* Did they change your hours and you don't want to wake up that early or it interferes with your part-time job you took to make ends meet? Tough.I used all 3 examples because all 3 have happened to me in my career. If I quit any of those jobs I wouldn't have collected unemployment even though I had good reason in each case.If the company is open and you refuse to work because you're worried about something, you don't collect unemployment. Corona isn't an exception. Otherwise, any person who quits any job for any reason will say they were ""worried"" in order to live on the public dole.If you don't like it then there's one thing you can do. FUCKING VOTE. Vote out the politicians who are in the pocket of big businesses who are driving the reopening your (my) States too early. That's what you need to do.PS: Unemployment isn't meant to allow you to live as you were before you were unemployed. It's meant as a temporary bridge to get you to your next job. Whether you disagree with that or not, that's the design of the program.PSS: Frankly, Millennials and post-Millennials haven't done themselves any favors. There are so many posts here and elsewhere crowing about how they're making more suckling off the government tit than they did before with the boost to unemployment pay. The people who pay for that - the shrinking middle class and big business - aren't going to do that long. The image of the ""welfare queens"" (Linda Taylor isn't the only one but if that name isn't familiar look it up) is a powerful, lasting image. Those sentiments about making more money sitting at home, while often true with good circumstances, just are fuel for the fire to those people who want to end the social safety net once and for all.",fp2fuyr,gauavq,2020-04-30 11:37:25

"Hi, I live in Oklahoma! It’s bad!The cost of living here is generally lower than in many other states. That being said, this minimum wage is still appalling. People still really struggle to make ends meet. Also, it’s not just the minimum wage workers who suffer because of this. Minimum wage lays the floor. If you live in a state with a $10.00 minimum wage, then any moderately skilled position has to offer more. In Oklahoma you can get $10.00/hr for work requiring significant training and skills. For example! I worked in a law office until recently. One of the legal secretaries managed all cases for a shareholding partner and several associates, networking with law firms, government agencies, and businesses, met and managed legal deadlines for all those cases, managed court dates, kept schedules — in effect, she was responsible for keeping the wheels turning for roughly 20% of this firm. She made less than $15 an hour and regularly worked shifts at a pizza parlor to make ends meet. She and her husband didn’t own their home and they bought their clothes at Goodwill and other secondhand stores/charity shops. I live in one of our major cities. It’s true that COL is higher here. However, in smaller towns and more rural areas, opportunities are even fewer and pay is even less. And I imagine you’d even find our major cities comparatively bleak. Our cost of living is low! Our minimum wage is lower. And plenty of people besides minimum wage workers suffer for it.",fp4k9p3,fp3a3ll,2020-04-30 22:41:38

"That makes sense. When I went back and read the article, it was specifically referring to people who were fired and then received an offer to get their jobs back. OK was encouraging employers to report employees who refused a job offer.Technically, a lot of states' programs function like this. People often are required to continually apply for jobs, and they lose their benefits if they refuse a job offer. California's technically works that way, although it generally relies on self-reported information that I doubt even gets audited that often.Still seems pretty lame, but it is basically the conservative counter to the liberal push to make unemployment benefits closer to what they've termed a ""livable wage"". I can hear the argument already, ""The government shouldn't dictate market wages, the market should.""

">But hey, I guess if I got to sit on my ass on unemployment getting paid to do nothing I'd be disinclined to go back to work too. You want to create jobs, but think that increasing consumer demand is the way to do it. But you also think that people shouldn't sit on their ass and get paid to do nothing because that means they'll never want to go back to work. So your solution is to not pay unemployed people who lost their jobs, thereby further decreasing consumer demand, thereby decreasing wages and decreasing job growth. You don't have any idea what you're talking about, do you?
